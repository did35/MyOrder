In this example after selecting different components representing a menu, clicking on the order button, the lable 'My order...' will be replaced by the items chosen and the pickerView (menu) will slide down with a delay of 0.5 sec.<br/>

A very simple example using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.<br/>
